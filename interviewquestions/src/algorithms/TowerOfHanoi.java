/**
 * The towers of hanoi is a popular problem. You have three poles and n disks
 * which fit on the poles. All disks have different size. They are stacked on
 * pole 1 in the orders of their size. The largest disk is on the bottom, the
 * smallest is on the top.
 * 
 * The task is to move all disk from pole 1 to pole 3 under the following
 * restrictions.
 * 
 * Only one disk can be moved
 * 
 * A larger disk can not be placed on a smaller disk.
 * 
 * The recursive algorithm works like the following: move n-1 disk from the
 * starting pole to the pole which is neither start nor target (intermediate),
 * move disk n to the target pole and then move n-1 disk from the intermediate
 * pole to the target pole. The n-1 disks are moved recursively.
